# KC_House_Price_Regression_Model
KC House Price Regression Model
This project focuses on predicting house prices in the KC area using a regression model. The project follows the following steps:

# Preprocessing:

Data cleaning and handling missing values.
Feature scaling or normalization.
Handling categorical variables (if applicable).
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzing and visualizing the distribution of the target variable (house prices) and independent variables.
Identifying correlations and relationships between variables.
Handling outliers and skewed data (if necessary).

# Model Evaluation:

Building and training regression models.
Evaluating the models using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared score.
Comparing the performance of different models.

# Hyperparameter Tuning:

Identifying the hyperparameters of the chosen regression model.
Performing hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search or random search.
Finding the optimal hyperparameter values that yield the best performance.
The goal of this project is to develop a regression model that accurately predicts house prices in the KC area. By following the above steps, we aim to preprocess the data, conduct EDA to gain insights, evaluate different regression models, and optimize the model's performance through hyperparameter tuning.
